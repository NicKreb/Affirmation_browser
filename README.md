# Affirmations Browser

The idea of the project is to recreate the domino's website, but flip it into a site to deliver me emails of affirmations at specific dates and times.

The project deadline is May 30th

It should have:

[-] Two color buttons pink and violet, with centered white text, and a monica monotone font.
[-] The homepage displays 4 clickable images each with an affirmation and a "deal" with a "price" listed on it.
[-] The bottom "deal" of the array should rotate between 2 "affirmation deals"
[-] The menu bar at the top should have the following options {Icon, Home, About, Order Online, Contact, Sign in/Sign up}
[-] The site should have a functional shopping page/menu of affirmations and motivations.
[-] These affirmations and motivations should have varying values, which get added and totalled at "checkout"
[-] On "purchase" the affirmations or motivations either pop up in a window, or are a copy and paste able text. (to protect user data since I don't intend on the site having anyway to hold emails).
[-] There should be a mock Log in and Sign up window.
[-] when resizing the window at a certain width the nav bar turns into a burger menu.
[-] there needs to be a functional cart that can have "products" added or removed by user.
