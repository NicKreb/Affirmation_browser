# Affirmations Browser

The idea of the project is to recreate the domino's website, but flip it into a site to deliver me emails of affirmations at specific dates and times.

The project deadline is May 30th

It should have:

[ ] Two color buttons pink and violet, with centered white text, and a monica monotone font.
[ ] The homepage displays 4 clickable images each with an affirmation and a "deal" with a "price" listed on it.
[ ] The bottom "deal" of the array should rotate between 2 "affirmation deals"
[ ] The menu bar at the top should have the following options {Icon, Home, About, Order Online, Contact, Sign in/Sign up}
[ ] ... (Will add more requirements within the week)
