# Affirmations Browser

The idea of the project is to recreate the domino's website, but flip it into a site to deliver me emails of affirmations at specific dates and times.

The project deadline is May 30th

It should have:


- [x] Two color buttons pink and violet, with centered white text, and a monica monotone font.
- [x] The homepage displays 4 clickable images each with an affirmation and a "deal" with a "price" listed on it.  
- [ ] The bottom "deal" of the array should rotate between 2 "affirmation deals"  
- [x] The menu bar at the top should have the following options {Icon, Home, About, Order Online, Contact, Sign in/Sign up}  
- [ ] The site should have a functional shopping page/menu of affirmations and motivations.  
- [ ] These affirmations and motivations should have varying values, which get added and totalled at "checkout"  
- [ ] On "purchase" the affirmations or motivations either pop up in a window, or are a copy and paste able text. (to protect user data since I don't intend on the site having anyway to hold emails).  
- [ ] There should be a mock Log in and Sign up window.  
- [ ] when resizing the window at a certain width the nav bar turns into a burger menu.  
- [ ] there needs to be a functional cart that can have "products" added or removed by user.  
- [ ] Clicking the back/return button should maintain the shopping carts items, and also return the user to where they were previously while maintaining the mock Log in user.
- [ ] Contacting should send an email to my professional email similar to my personal web page.

##Optional goals

- [ ] Icons such as an envelope w/ a heart for the web page icon. that opens when mouse clicking/tapping it.
- [ ] Background should be a tiled background that seamlessly blends together and runs off screen for a full background.
